## Journal Entry
> #### Session 1
> She works at the tavern in Asker, a kind open minded person. Once we grouped up, the bartender. I believe her to be an innocent spirit, as she seeked shelter when the Inn got attacked. I wish her nothing but good fortune coming forward.
> 
> When sat down with the other travellers, she is the one that informed us on the task at hand ([[Retrieve Artefact]]). I'm not too sure why she knew about this task.
