# `=this.file.name`
> #### Description
> Hel is one of the few rare of its kind, a Dark Elf. Their demeanour seems always pretty relaxed and careless, despite her psychotic behaviour. Any time spent around her should be short as her intentions are nothing but her own personal gain, and will not hesitate to make you her next victim.
> 
> Something quite rare of the Dark Elves though, is the fact that she appears to be a mother. A trait nobody though was possible.
> 
> #### Appearance
> She dons black armour pieces, blending in with her natural vanta black skin tone. Her eyes are a piercing white colour, with her hair complimenting her eyes too. Red markings trail her upper body, which pulsate in according to her power. 
> 
> #### Traits
> **Trained Martial Artist**
> She seems well versed in the art of combat, making her a formidable opponent up close.
> 
> **Spellcaster**
> She wields unnatural magic that seems to have no bounds, allowing her to shape the battlefield to her desire.
>   
>  **Crazed**
>  A common trait shared by Dark Elves, her actions are undoubtedly evil, making her a danger to anyone around her.

  >#### SESSION 2
  >I met her at the riverbank of the Ghost Town. In an attempt to sway her from following us, I confronted them. However the longer I remained in near proximity of her, the more my surroundings started to warp, as if she can alter reality itself. What is more concerning is that I felt the spirits around me actually die as she stepped closer. I'm going to have to find a way to overcome this.

  >In our conversation she talked about how she does her cruel acts purely out of enjoyment.. is there truly no justification to their actions? There has to be something that caused her to be the way she is.
  >
  >She also mentioned someone called "Nyhl", who seems to be the one responsible for destroying the gate, who also seems to have done it for no apparent reason.. this mission would be much easier if there were any justifications to any of this..
