## Journal Entry
> #### Session 2
> I found him first defending a cabin alongside his wounded friend. Given my lessons on the Silver Elves, I thought it was morally right to go and help him, and I believe to have made the right choice. After the fight, he seemed thankful for our aid, and invited us to the cabin, where he shows the silver elves he was defending. I respect this man with my highest regard, he is a warrior like me, fulfilling his duty in trying times.

> He explained that his mission is to keep the royal family safe, so he has to move around from location to location, though doesn't seem to want to leave the Alfheim region. If only I could aid him in his journey. Perhaps after I've fulfilled my duty, and remain alive.. I can find him again.
