## Journal Entry
>#### Session 2
>I found this royal in the cabin, next to a cradle with a baby in it. They explained how they are taking care of the baby who is the last one of its kind. The baby's name is "Olivia Parmenides", who had a blue crystal pendant on them, which the royal explained is a family heirloom to the Parmenides.
