# SESSION 1

The scary mercenary mentioned his silver sword was from up north, next to some dead elves

elves were burnt by terremis soldiers

Peasants rushed into the tavern, talking about about a group of soldiers trying to subdue a beast outside, and seem to struggle a lot about it.

An illustration of a small chest, with silver elf ornaments, a handfull in size. The illustration itself, was very elegant, someone knew how this looks like. The task is well paid, 3 elven trite for each party member. We need to infiltrate the capital, Alfheim for this artefact. Something noteworthy is that the capital is in the middle of a war zone. Upon returning with the trinket to Glutt-inn, we'll meet a man to deliver the goods and get our reward. The artefact is inside the castle in Alfheim, locked away somewhere.

i got 5 Crowns

The scary mercenaries are also planning to go to Alfheim

A river town was discovered near the river towards Alfheim, not marked on the map. Everyone is dead. People hanging from trees, the nooses 

We talked to one of the dead peasants, they mentioned that a dark elf commanded them all to kill themselves, as well as mentioning the dark elf did this merely as a distraction. While its main objective was to leave towards Terremis.

We find a child left alive in one of the houses, it was left paralysed, and after a further investigation revealed that he has been marked by a dark elf with a bite on the neck. Augur ended this interaction with sending the child to a different location in the world.

# DOWNTIME 1
Momo and Don walked around the Ghost town, found 2 children in need of help, one of them have bloated purple arms, of khaos origin. Don means to say its a mark of the dark elf

Lassandra and Ullr followed some tracks from the child we found in session 1, it lead to a cabin where they later found a Dark Elf surprising them. The Dark elf, "Hel" seems to be related to the Dark Elf child we killed.

Augur finished his ritual on the first child

Zaggatha continued burning the corpses

# Session 2
Hel has the ability to warp space in Syleris, her red markings pulsate and she cackles, it also disputes all magic and spirits

Hel mentioned someone called Nyhl, who destroyed the gate, for no apparent reason.

Hel was hired by an elf to get revenge on Terremis, it is unclear why she accepted it

Tower has a banner of a white snake and a blue background

We discovered Don’s home town, completely scorched, and Don’s name was actually inherited from a dead friend

We arrived at a nearby town in Alfheim where we rested without any problems. I found some better clothes for the children i temporarily adopted, they seem to trust me more and more as they join me til i find a safe town

We arrived closer to Alfheim where we spotted two silver elves fighting a group of mercs, they seem to be defending a cabin

After the battle we discovered the cabin had several wounded silver elves, some of them being the last of their noble family.

One of the silver elves is a baby who seems to have a blue crystal pendant, emanating powerful spiritual energy

The crystal is engraved in a language only Momo can read, "Nous"

Olivia Parmaniedes, is the baby

The surviving royal family gave me a skeleton key, it will unlock most doors in the capital.

Theres a mage in the very capital of Alfheim, who has gone missing after his wife and kid died, but his residency should still be available for research

I made an infiltration kit

# Downtime 2
We talked to the silver elf Royals about intimacy, their names was Julian and Elizabeth Stembock

Don got embarassed thinking we were talking about relationships

Momo and Zaggatha stepped outside to take a breather

# Session 3
Elliot is the name of the hot guy soldier

Theres corpses burning in the capital, a lot of them seems to be terremiss guards

The snake artefact was not possible to break by normal means, it was attempted to be sealed in a chest with. a blue crystal. Similar to that chest in the start of wotv, explained by Julian(?)

Magnus is the mages name, researched the dark elves

Some of Magnus' apprentices might be alive

We found an elevated town, going towards the capital

Theres a hot spring bath in Alden, bathing in it will give you medicinal purposes

In the capital we found a wounded Terremis guard (Liv), who we helped burn the body of their dead comrade. 

At the entrance of the castle, we found remains of a battle with little to no Terremis casualties, massive arrows piercing the walls, and a larger crater in the ground as if someone/something crashed here.

# Downtime 3

We met a peculiar beast-like person named Rose. She seems to be hoarding the silver elf treasure at the castle, and shows marks of khaos on her body. She explained that she took the offer from a talking flower, and now her body constantly suffers.

Rose carries the silver ornament coffer we were looking for, however it seems that she needs it herself to keep the khaos magic from overpowering her own body, causing her pain.

We introduced ourselves and she has offered to stay at her residence

# Session 4

Rose seems wary of getting in close contact with us, does her khaos magic do something on contact?

we decided to join Rose for tea at her residence and then return to the Syleris Castle. Upon going through a rift that Rose made, we entered a very floral and peaceful place, with a large treehouse in front of us, in the style of a Bonsai tree.
 
Rose has a chicken called Ginger, and an orange cat

Rose has a collection of artifacts that we can get if we get her things in exchange, we use the bell Lassandra got to get in contact with Rose.

Wind Cloak (Price: Rock sized chunk of silver)
Leaf green leather boots
Small perfume
Tankard
Leather cloth sack with runes
Bronze framed Helmet with a purple gemstone
Pendant with a ruby and two bronze hands holding it
Sky blue gemstone
Empty bag
Ping pearl
Metal goggles
Cloak with eyes

I got half a handful of silver elf pearl from a cloak

We discovered the tower of Magnus the Mage, it appears there was a large battle here

Magnus appears a little bit taller, his robes were larger than normal

A note from Magnus Vahl:
"If you reading this, i am dead, I have returned to my wife, and daughter. There is no need for you to seek me out. I have left my research, in this very room."

All the books left in this room are written by Magnus

One contains info about Crown of Nyhl, it wasn't always there. It appeared out of thin around year 0. Magnus was around 300 years old at the time of writing this. Before CoN, there was an almost bottomless circular ravine, with water at the bottom. Across the ravine there is a icy area. His ancestors never really got the chance to explore this place.

A personal note mentions his first dark elf find, he found it when going closer to CoN, the dark elf just sat there and responded to his questions with short answers. The dark elf was contempt for some strange reason. there are notes on psychology, their very nature is rooted in hopelessness and despair. They find purpose in this. Just like humans and elf alike, the way they handle this is different from Dark Elf to Dark Elf, like how we people are complicated, rooted in our own natures, the same goes for our dark elves. We can find similarities strikingly similar to human and elf psychology, with just more contrast. Although Momo notices something else, most Dark elves are cruel, but its how like how people are fine, but there are outliers, with their own fascinations. Magnus figured out that most Dark elves are fond of music. At around Year 100 (Magnus was 200), he had a terrifying encounter with Hel. She didnt seem aggressive, and welcomed Magnus, which he found scary and try to flee, but his magic failed him. They sat down for a chat, Hel seemed very energetic. Hel was talking about Nyhl, with a very appraising manner, almost appreciating them like a Deity, or a very important figure. When parting ways, Hel gave Magnus the ornate chest, that we found out was the relic with the 5 empty slots. This relic, a circular emblem, was intrusted to him by the royals, and found striking similarities between this emblem and the relic inside the chest, and realized it was not a wise move to put the artefact in the chest, as it would fit. Magnus ended up lying to the Royals about what he found in the chest, and just said it was another emblem.
 
Other notes explain his progress in magical arts, he has explored a lot of Syleris.

A new book explains how Magnus's father tried to unite Alfheim with the rest of Syleris, by introducing Silver Elf infastructure around Syleris. These attempts were futile as around year 50, he was killed by some guy who was a little too greedy. Ever since, Alfheim has been completely isolated.

We met a highly decorated Terremis soldier in Magnus's tower, who was very keen on attacking Zaggatha and Augur. Don asked if they know if Liv made it out alive, which the terremis guard seemed very dismissive on answering, she did not care.
