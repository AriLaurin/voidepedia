The scary mercenary mentioned his silver sword was from up north, next to some dead elves

elves were burnt by terremis soldiers

Peasants rushed into the tavern, talking about about a group of soldiers trying to subdue a beast outside, and seem to struggle a lot about it.

An illustration of a small chest, with silver elf ornaments, a handfull in size. The illustration itself, was very elegant, someone knew how this looks like. The task is well paid, 3 elven trite for each party member. We need to infiltrate the capital, Alfheim for this artefact. Something noteworthy is that the capital is in the middle of a war zone. Upon returning with the trinket to Glutt-inn, we'll meet a man to deliver the goods and get our reward. The artefact is inside the castle in Alfheim, locked away somewhere.

i got 5 Crowns

The scary mercenaries are also planning to go to Alfheim

A river town was discovered near the river towards Alfheim, not marked on the map. Everyone is dead. People hanging from trees, the nooses 

We talked to one of the dead peasants, they mentioned that a dark elf commanded them all to kill themselves, as well as mentioning the dark elf did this merely as a distraction. While its main objective was to leave towards Terremis.

We find a child left alive in one of the houses, it was left paralysed, and after a further investigation revealed that he has been marked by a dark elf with a bite on the neck. Augur ended this interaction with sending the child to a different location in the world.
