> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> We were tasked by the tiefling bartender with retrieving a small, hand-sized chest with silver-elf ornaments. We were given a parchment with an illustration of the chest, it seemed to have been drawn by memory, although with perfect memory.. whoever drew this knew exactly what it looked like.
> 
> The task requires us to infiltrate the capital of Alfheim, Alden, which is currently in the middle of a large-scale conflict. The castle itself however has been reported to be abandoned and many mercenaries flock too it for their chance at treasure. The same group of mercenaries that we saw before ([[Scary Mercenary & Co]]) have said that they too have their eyes fixated on Alfheim for their opportunity to ransack the castle.
> 
> If we successfully retrieve the artefact, we are to return to Glutt-Inn in [[Asker]], and await our reward of 3 Elven Trite, upon delivery.
