## Journal Entry
>#### Session 1
> During the fight with the dark elf, this mouse's true background was revealed. They lashed out towards the Dark elf, repeatedly stabbing it in a feral rage. It seems this dispute was rather personal to the mouse, which was later revealed to be because one of the dark elves have burnt down the mouse's village. Quite a grim tale.
> 
> They later apologised for their outburst, I believe they did not mean to burst out in a rage like this. Despite their size they seem to have a fiery spirit, though they also carry a heavy load on their mind, I do wish I could help this poor mouse with their troubles, they could be destined to achieve much good.
> 
> #### Session 2
> We visited their hometown, and I see now where their trauma originates from. A terrible fire ate their entire village, and by the looks of it, Don is the last one of their kind. I sympathise deeply with them.. if only I could be a better role model for them.
> 
> While we were on our way out of the village, they told us that "Don Quixote" was the name they inherited from their friend who died in the village.. I wonder why they don't use their own name.
> 
> After our fight with the mercenaries near the Silver Elf Cabin, it seems more and more apparent that Don lacks general understanding of ethics, a cause and effect of a poor uprising. I wish to teach them the better ways of the world, if I ever get the chance.
