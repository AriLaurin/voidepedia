## Journal Entry
>#### Session 1
>A masked male approached the table I sat at with the other people who also came here for the task we were told about. His accent was rather interesting, though he seemed happy to talk to us.
>
>We figured out he was also apart of the band that was supposed to join for the task to Alfheim. He seems like a good guy, as he helped me save the dying guard from a fatal wound. There's no doubt in my mind that there are still good spirits around Syleris, for he is one of them. Perhaps if I stick around him, my ability to do good could drastically improve.
>
>#### Session 2
>He seemed quite absent on our journey towards Alfheim, he simply followed along and helped us, ofcourse I won't say that is a small feat but.. I wonder if there is more to why he remains so silent.
>
>None the less I think his spirit is pure, as he proves yet again to be a kind hearted man, both on the road and in battle. I can feel my own spirits lighten up from just staying around him.
