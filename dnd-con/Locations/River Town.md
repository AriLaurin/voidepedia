# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
>We discovered a River town on our way towards Alfheim, strangely enough it wasn't marked on the map. Upon arrival we were greeted with hanged corpses on every low branch we could see. All the nooses seem to be tied perfectly and theres a stool under each and every one of them, a synchronous suicide happened here.
> 
> [[Augur]] used some sort of necromancy to talk with one of the dead peasants, where we could ask five questions. Upon questioning we discovered that a dark elf commanded the entire town to kill themselves, with no further motive. The river town was not the dark elf's main attraction, as their destination was set towards right after this, a mere distraction this was.
> 
> We walked further into the town and discovered a lone child in one of the houses, paralysed in fear. His parents were dead in the house with him and the child was in a terrible mental state. It sat in the corner of the room, hunkered down and refused to communicate with us. Upon further inspection of the child, we discover that it has been marked by a [[Dark Elf]], with a deep bite mark on the neck. The party was in a bit of a stalemate about what we should do.
> 
> I stepped outside and attempted a prayer, asking the spirits to protect this house from evil spirits, though it seems like the child themselves rejected any sort of protection from the spirits.. something tells me his fate is already sealed.
> 
> [[Lassandra]] discovers that the room has some large bootprints around the house, which lead outside, something tells us this child has not been completely alone. She decided to go outside and track these bootprints together with [[Ullr Bergelund]].
> 
> Once more [[Augur]] steps forward in an attempt to put an end to this child, by casting some strange voodoo magic, casting the child away from this house and of to anywhere else on this plane.
> 
> [[Zaggatha]] went back to the corpses on the trees, and crucified every single one of them in hellfire, to prevent any sort of disease from spreading.
