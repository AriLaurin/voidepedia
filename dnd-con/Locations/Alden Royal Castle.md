# `=this.file.name`
## Overview
The castle is in the process of ruination, after still standing upright after the war. The front gate is breached, with signs of someone of a larger size ramming through, leaving the castle walls with holes and the doors broken down. Despite this the castle still stands, and overshadows every other building around it, with much to uncover.
