Sensei told me they are a formidable foe, which they surely were, I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it get tossed into the tavern with an axe lodged in them. I didn't get the chance to get a blow in myself, nor could I protect those who attacked it directly.. I have much to learn before I can encounter the next one."

This one had red markings and had unimaginable power to the point where it seems like it maddening them. They seem to be capable of conversation, which leads me to question their intentions. Have they always been this crazed?"
