> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> A diamond like shell can open itself to reveal a black pearl inside. On the pearl itself you can see unique runes carved on them. Activating them attracts the material the statues are made of, forming some sort of amalgamation. Deactivating it makes the amalgamation go back to normal black sand.

> [!abstract] NOTES
> I have found a few variations of this artefact, some of them have a black pearl inside, but there were these "magnet" like version of these where the pearl was purple and attracted an identical copy of the artefact.
> 
> On a table in the tower, I found a purple pearl outside of its shell, inserting it into a slot on a handle, alongside pouring some black sand, shaped yet again another amalgamation.
