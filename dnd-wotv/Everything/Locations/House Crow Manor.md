> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> House Crow is a generationally wealthy family, though they try their best to hide it. They are famed for their vast network and control over many districts that are thought to be out of reach for them. The main manor itself is located in an undisclosed forest, for the safety of the House's foundation. None the less this place is rumoured to be styled in a victorian fashion, with an heir to rule the house.
