> [!abstract] BACKSTORY
> Angel's tale began in the smouldering embers of her infernal heritage. Born under the strong family name [[House Crow]], her grandfather ([[Marilynn Crow]]), a renowned alchemical artificer, toiled away in a guild ([[House of Salvation Headquarters]]) residing in a bustling city. She delved into the mysteries of magical machinery. Entranced by the whirring gears and bubbling concoctions that filled her childhood home, Angel's destiny was set from a young age.
> 
> Accepted into the guild ([[House of Salvation]]) that her grandfather once called home, Angel's insatiable curiosity found its focus in the realm of alchemy and artifice. She spent her formative years surrounded by schematics and blueprints, her nimble fingers crafting intricate devices that danced between the magical and the mechanical. The guild became her second family, nurturing her burgeoning talents.
> 
> In her teenage years, Angel became enthralled by the groundbreaking work of Tagror Grevson [["Taggy"]], a seasoned artificer within the guild. Witnessing Tagror's audacious project of gradually replacing his own body with intricate machinery, Angel, driven by insatiable curiosity, beseeched him to allow her a closer look and the opportunity to study his methods. After persistent requests, Tagror relented, permitting Angel to observe and eventually collaborate. Together, their efforts culminated in a remarkable achievementâ€”the successful transfer of Tagror's consciousness into the unyielding form of a warforged.
> 
> However, the taste of success only fueled Angel's hunger for knowledge. As she entered young adulthood, her focus shifted from the marvels of invention to the mysteries of the creatures that roamed the realms. Her obsession with understanding the intricacies of life and death intensified, she turned a new page in her journey as she delved further into her obsessed research.
