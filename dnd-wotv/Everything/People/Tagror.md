> [!abstract] BACKSTORY
> From flesh to machine Tagror, once a human artificer, harbored a profound fascination with the untapped potential of machinery. His passion for replacing human limitations with mechanical enhancements was well-known within the House of Salvation. His expertise and dedication led to him taking on an apprentice, a young Tiefling named Angel.
> 
>  [["Angel"]], though still in her teenyears, had already demonstrated a remarkable affinity for artifice. She was drawn to Tagror's work, especially his fascination with replacing body parts and limbs with mechanical counterparts. She began pestering Tagror to allow her to observe his work up close, eagerly seeking to learn from the master of mechanical craftsmanship.
>  
>   At first, Tagror was reluctant to take Angel under his wing, but her unwavering enthusiasm and determination eventually won him over. He begrudgingly agreed to mentor her, allowing her to closely observe his intricate work and learn the art of crafting. Over time, a strong bond developed between them, as Tagror shared his knowledge and skills with his determined young apprentice. 
>   
>   One day, Tagror revealed his daring idea to Angelâ€”that he believed by transferring his consciousness into a Warforged body, he could transcend the limitations of flesh and achieve the pinnacle of existence. He invited her to be an integral part of this transformation. Together, they meticulously designed a specialized Warforged body for this purpose and successfully completed the intricate ritual. Tagror emerged as a being of pure, unyielding metal, liberated from the constraints of his human form.
>   
>    Tagror and Angel continued their relentless pursuit of innovation within the House of Salvation. Their groundbreaking contributions and inventive creations were a testament to their extraordinary partnership and shared passion for mechanical perfection. Tagror's promotion to the coveted rank of Veteran Artificer Officer was imminent, despite the ethical questions surrounding his transformation. Some within the guild saw it as a radical step, while others admired his dedication to a unique vision. The words etched onto his metallic form served as a constant reminder of his journey from human to Warforged: "There is no truth in flesh, only the pursuit of excellence." These words encapsulated his dedication to mechanical perfection and the relentless pursuit of excellence that defined his life as an artificer.
