> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> Action: 1 Attack Action
> To hit: +4 (Alchemical Savant)
> Time to Activate: Instant
> Canisters: 5/5 (restored per long rest if resources are available)
>  Resources required (1 Canister): 2 Uses of Salt Jar, 3 Uses of extracted methane compound
>  
> Firing a canister at the target will release impact activated hooks that dig into the targets skin, the canister begins a chloroform build up. If you successfully hit the target (rolling above their AC), the canisters secure themselves on the target and dig their hooks into their skin, allowing the chloroform to be injected. If you fail to hit the target, the canisters break on impact and nothing happens.
> 
>  On a successful hit, depending on the targets current health, the target will undergo a exponentially rising stage of stacking effects. The first stage is a feeling of fatigue, the target becomes sluggish and loses half their movement speed. The second stage is feeling of sluggishness, the target can only perform one action per turn, (still allowed to move at half speed). The third and last stage is a paralysing coma, the target feels a crashing sensation of numbing as their nervous system collapse, sending them into a paralysing coma for two hours. The target wakes up with three levels of exhaustion. 
>  
>  On-site reload: If the canister did not break and successfully hooked itself onto a target, you can carefully detach the canisters, and refuel them on a short rest, if resources are available.

> [!abstract] NOTES
> A single Salt Jar has 10/10 uses. Small game rotten flesh can produce 5 methane compounds, Medium game rotten flesh can produce 10 methane compounds, Big game rotten flesh can produce 15 methane compounds.
