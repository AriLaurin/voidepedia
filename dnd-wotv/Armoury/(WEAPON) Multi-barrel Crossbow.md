> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> [["Angel"]] needs to build an arsenal if she is to survive in [[Soltoppen]]. So she draws a blueprint for a custom wrist-mounted crossbow that could fire four bolts at once. Additionally, with some artificer magic, this crossbow could have repeating rounds, without needing to reload. The purpose of this weapon is to have a quick and accessible ranged weapon on her at all times to deal with one or more targets at once.
