> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> Using one of the cores from the statues, without khaos' runic inscryptions, Angel carves her own runes, replicating that of an homunculus servant. This bird was built with the purpose of being Angels' eyes in the skies. 
> 
> **Drone Mode** (Passive Ability, can only be used if bird is present)
> Angel can command the bird to fly and with the runes carved into the core of the bird, these same runes are carved on her new glasses. This allows her to see through the birds' point of view. However, Angel can only see through the bird when the bird is within a 125ft radius.
> 
> **Reconnaissance  Mode**
> The mechanical bird is a sentient being, allowing the bird to travel by itself. Once every long rest, Angel can command her bird to travel to a location that Angel has been to before and cannot return until next long rest. During this reconnaissance, the bird will record the things it can observe, and can be viewed by Angel as a recording upon return.
> 
> **Hunter Mode**
> Once a long rest, Angel can command the bird to forage for requested small resources that Angel has observed before, plants and light weight objects alike.
