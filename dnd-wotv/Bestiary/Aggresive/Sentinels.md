> [!tip] Angels Kill Count: 2

> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> These statues made of what looks like metal, however when you touch them, they have this "dust-like" texture to them. Breaking these statues reveal them to be closer to some sort of black sand. These statues have an activation phase, as when they are inactive, they look like normal statues. However, if one were to approach these alone, they would activate. These purple runes run down them and turn sentient. 
> 
> Theres two types of Sentinels recorded so far, Mighty Sentinels & Agile Sentinels. You can see the difference by the statues physical build, a smaller build would mean an Agile Sentinel, whilst a broader and taller build would mean you are facing a Mighty Sentinel. Mighty Sentinels can be described to have inhumane strength, wielding claymores. Agile Sentinels are as explained, incredibly agile and can sometimes carry smaller weapons, or attack unarmed.
> 
> These creatures dont seem to have any emotion or express themselves in any sort of way, concluding that these statues have been animated by the painted runes that appear on them. However they do show a sign of intelligence when in combat. They can coherently work together and know when to retreat when wounded.

> [!abstract] NOTES
>  I have witnessed the runes activate and deactivate mid combat, could there be a limited amount that is controlled at once?
> Andraste hit it with a really powerful blow, turns out it shattered and deactivated. The other sentinel next to it, reacted to this... strange. It dropped on its knees and deactivated itself..?
> A diamond shaped artefact dropped from inside the sentinel. This artefact opened and revealed a black pearl like crystal inside.
