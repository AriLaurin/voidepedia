> [!tip] Angels Kill Count: 

> [!info] DESCRIPTION
>  Ludwig had a mutilated appearance, forming fleshy amalgamations as he grows in size. As he was huge in size, this creature was also rather slow. None the less it appeared to be a difficult opponent, with their large blade, blue sparks followed its trail and would leave a rotten residue open contact with skin.
>  
>  Ludwig seemed to also have a mask that kept regrowing if attempted to take off. They moaned in agony and always repeated these words "Help me". Upon examining the inner pieces of Ludwig, we can find that his armoury was made out of the very own iron in their blood.
