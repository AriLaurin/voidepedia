> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> While talking to [["???" Dragonborn KhÃ¡os Cultist]], [["Angel"]] discovered the existence of a deity known as [[Cosmos]]. She began looking for signs of this deity in [[Soltoppen]] after leaving [[Black Space]].
> 
> During the final fight in the [[Tower Amidst The Desert]], [["Taggy"]], [[Andraste Helder]] and [[Maralog]] were transported to [[Black Space]]. When they tried to leave this time, [["Taggy"]] appeared in a library with all of the party members hanging from hooks. [["Taggy"]] reached for [["Angel"]] first and woke up, then approached a table in the library that reached so far back we couldn't see the other side. This other side had an all knowing individual speak to us, referred to as [[The Librarian]]. After striking a deal, [[The Librarian]] told us that we could find [[Cosmos]] in southern [[Soltoppen]].
