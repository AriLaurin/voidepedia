> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> When a [[Sentinels]] attacked [["Angel"]], [["Taggy"]] and [[Andraste Helder]], the attack opened a rift to [[Black Space]] where they were teleported into. Discovering a whole new dimension in this rift, the band of three quickly discover that they were not welcome here. As the surrounding was all black, though strangely enough they were in some kind of forest ([[Forest Amidst Black Space]]). While the sky was jet black, there were these ominous huge eyes ([[Eyes of Black Space]]) staring at them the entire time, sometimes moving closer and squinting at them.
> 
> We didn't drop our guard though, as eerie sounds rustled all around us, and some horror beyond explanation creeped around us ([[Entropy]]). In a panic we all ran into the woods, trying to escape the thing, however it was faster and angrier than before. Chasing after us we soon came to a stop when we realised it stopped chasing us. 
> 
> Though things did not turn out better, where there was previously grass, it was now all black. Suddenly, these [[Black Space Tentacles]] appeared out of no where, and were creeping towards us. [["Taggy"]] decided to plea for forgiveness, though it seems that the tentacles decided not to harm us, instead they began slithering up our arms. I rejected these tentacles, ripping myself away from their grasp. However, [["Taggy"]] and [[Andraste Helder]] decided to embrace it. It ended up digging into their arms, and infected it with its strange markings.
> 
> After this ominous embrace, the tentacles fled, and the horrifying creature returned ([[Entropy]]). This time however, [["Taggy"]]'s marked arm opened an exit for all of us, where [[Andraste Helder]] and [["Taggy"]] jumped in first, though I had other plans. my fight or flight instinct kicked in and in so, I readied herself, freeing my impish wings out and in the nick of time, flew away from the horrifying creature in time. It appeared the creature could not fly, so I was safe in the air. 
> 
> I decided to look at the creature for a while, see what it does, it looked like it was trying to enter [["Taggy"]]'s exit. I was worried the creature would fall in, but somehow, when I spoke the words "close", the exit closed. I had to find a new way out of here.
> 
> I flew above the forest and noticed that the [[Eyes of Black Space]] formed up in a line, as it looked like it was leading me somewhere. I followed it until I eventually discovered a primitive village ([[Cultist Village Amidst The Forest]]) a little further in. What was a village doing in this rift? Alongside the village was a church, with torches lit inside. I flew towards the top to sneak in and see what was going on, and to my surprise there were people here. Though their faced was blurred, and a large dragonborn stood on the podium ([["???" Dragonborn Kháos Cultist]]). I lurked above them on the support beams, and noticed that whenever they spoke their name, it was blurred out with some speech I could not understand.
> 
> To my surprise, the dragonborn felt my presence and would immediately look at me, shocked and in panic, i tried to flee to another room. However, the dragonborn suddenly appeared infront of me as he opened a rift and then sent a eerie shiver down my spine. We spoke together, as it seemed like my only option, then the dragonborn proceeded to drag me down to the podium, where he questions me: "Do you like [[Kháos]] or [[Cosmos]]?". It appears these are two entities or gods amongst us, and infront of the podium was a statue of a massive eyeball with wings, I took assumption in imagining that this is [[Kháos]]. 
> 
> The dragonborn proceeded with some sort of [[Kháos Cultist Ritual]], where I was pierced with similar tentacles that ate at my friends. In an attempt to escape i tried to rip my hands out of their grasp, though not for long as [[Entropy]] comes crashing through the church entrance, with [["Taggy"]] in their grasp. I took this opportunity to escape, while [["Taggy"]] in a split second decision, took it upon himself to take my place in the ritual, finishing the binding he did with the tentacles. The Dragonborn finished the ritual with [["Taggy"]] where it appears he has gotten newfound powers, and from that point forward, the dragonborn let us escape back through his own rift, where we would return to [[Tower Amidst The Desert]].
> 
> When arriving in [[Zefarane]], I came across [[Hanz Strauth]] who appears to be plagued with [[Kháos]]' curse. However, it appears he is making an active attempt at abolishing anyone who wrongfully has the mark of [[Kháos]] and [[House Strauth]] seems to have taken an interest in researching all things related to [[Kháos]].
> 
> While in combat with [[Hanz Strauth]] and [[Theresa Strauth]], a magic spear laced with [[Cosmos]]' divine magic, seems to work as a weakness towards [[Kháos' Followers]], as their curse diminishes when close to it.
