> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> When in [[Zefarane]] we met upon [[Hanz Strauth]] and [[Theresa Strauth]], furthermore, in the [[Great Library of Zefarane]], we found out that a certain [[Victor Strauth]] has been documenting a lot of the magic in this world. We learned that [[House Strauth Estate]] is located in [[Terremis]], perhaps we can meet [[Victor Strauth]] there.
