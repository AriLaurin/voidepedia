> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> [["Angel"]] and [["Taggy"]] were requested to meet [[Griznak, Artificer General]], the head of [[House of Salvation]]. Here they would be given a task that could potentially mark a new chapter in artificer discoveries. It is foretold that there is a lot of mystery around the things happening in [[Soltoppen]], and if we were to discover these mysteries and show them to the guild, we'd be rewarded generously and get promoted.
> 
> For [["Angel"]], this was the perfect time to finally work on her personal study of discovering the monsters and life alike in the world. All in the while, [["Taggy"]] tells me that this could be the key to completing his body transformation, that there has to be something out there that could help us. So we decided to take upon this daunting task, and disembarked of to [[Soltoppen]].
> 
> [["Taggy"]] asked [[The Librarian]] if we could use [[Kh√°os]]' magic to transmute a body, which was possible, however it came at the cost of losing your soul upon getting hurt and feeling said pain, which was not to our expectations.
