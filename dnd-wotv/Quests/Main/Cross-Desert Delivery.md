> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> The first thing we needed when we arrived in [[Bri]] was coin, for we had to supply ourselves during our time in this region. No guild members were coming for us so we joined a band of misfits and took upon a contract. This is where we ([["Angel"]] and [["Taggy"]]) met upon [[Andraste Helder]], [[Maralog]] and [[Yastrix]], our party members. When talking to the taskmaster [["xQc"]], we were met with a disappointed look. The taskmaster was not pleased with his new contractors, as he mentions that we looked like the most disappointed band of misfits he has ever seen. None the less we took up the contract for a solid 500 gold coins to split amongst the party.
> 
> The task required us to carry a magically sealed chest ([[Chest With A Gem]]) across a deadly desert for a few days. Luckily we were given a [[Magic Compass]] that would lead us straight through a safe passage.
> 
> We resupplied at an [[Outpost outside of Bri]] and embarked on the path and after a while attempted to rest on the open desert terrain while remaining inside the "safe passage". However, awoken up by a sandstorm, we had to flee. It appears the magic compass has broken and the safe passage had strayed away from us. While fleeing the sandstorm, we heard an ominous roar around us, and the ground was rumbling, yet we could not see what this impending doom was ([[Creature of the Desert]]), so we kept running.
> 
> Luckily we found a lighthouse in the middle of nowhere ([[Josef's Lighthouse]]), seeking shelter here we came across the resident of this lighthouse, [["Old Man Josef"]]. The old man told us that where we came from, makes no sense as it simply does not exist, according to him. However there was a town up ahead that we could check out for further guidance. It appears that amidst the storm, we have somehow been sent to a new realm? ([[Soltoppen]])
> 
> After spending the night at the [[Josef's Lighthouse]], we travelled to the town up ahead called [[Dysnomia]]. A desert residence full of lowlifes and criminals. We were certainly not welcomed with glee, as one man ([[Amir Osman]]) approached us, questioning our decision of coming here. We told him our story and he is surprised we are even alive. Apparently we need these necklaces called [[Beetle Amulet]]s to safely cross the desert, else we would end up lost and eventually die a horrible death.. or so he says. 
> 
> Since we knew no other way of crossing the desert, we decided to try and find said amulets. [[Amir Osman]] offered the party to find his lost comrades amulets, as they are most likely dead by now and would have no use for them. He mentioned that we would find these at the [[Tower Amidst The Desert]]. 
> 
> Upon completing our task at the [[Tower Amidst The Desert]], we were guided by [[Amir Osman]] to travel for [[Zefarane]], where we could find more help to cross the desert. So we did, we travelled for what was almost a day and discovered a bustling city in the desert. There are shops everywhere and many more friendly faces.
> 
> In [[Zefarane]] we found answers to where we are, though no answer to how to cross the desert. For this we had to find someone in [[Soltoppen]]. [[Zefarane]] was not lackluster of tasks to do however, as our venture to the city was very eventful.
