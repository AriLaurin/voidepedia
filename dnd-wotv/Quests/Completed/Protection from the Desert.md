> [!info] DESCRIPTION
> [["Angel"]], [["Taggy"]], [[Andraste Helder]], [[Yastrix]] and [[Maralog]] found the town of [[Dysnomia]] in [[Soltoppen]], where they came across [[Amir Osman]].
> 
> [[Amir Osman]] offered us 15 gold coins if we were to find his lost comrades in the [[Tower Amidst The Desert]], in addition to a hint that we might find some [[Beetle Amulet]]s so we could safely cross the desert, for if not, we were bound to be eaten up by [[Sandsharks]], [[Amir Osman]] mentions. We accepted this task and went for the [[Tower Amidst The Desert]].
> 
> While travelling we came across many ruins, some ruins even had runes ([[Ancient Symbols Amongst Ruins]]).
> 
> Upon arrival we noticed these strange statues made of what appears to be this odd black material, a little grainy on the texture. [[Yastrix]] decided to smash one of the statues and it crumpled into a pile of black sand. I took a sample of this for further research and we went inside the tower.
> 
> Once we arrived we felt an eerie and heavy presence in the halls. None the less we ventured onwards and discovered a few rooms. A library, a mess hall and a massive door in the center. In the two rooms we examined two skeletal corpses that stood next to statues. On one of them, there was a note that mentioned a long corridor with many statues down it. Mysteriously enough, we split off a little to loot these rooms, until suddenly [[Yastrix]] was attacked by a statue ([[Sentinels]]). 
> 
> After fending them off we noticed that everything in this tower is not of this world, amongst this there were books in an [[Unknown Language]] ([[Book written in an unknown language]]), the [[Sentinel Magic]] was not like the magic I have worked with and these [[Sentinel Artefact]]s were inscribed with runes I have never seen before. 
> 
>In a room locked behind a stone door in the library, we found a small experimentation room it seems like. We found two magnetic [[Sentinel Artefact]]s and a strange cube like object ([["Kevin" Sentinal Cube]]). However, It wouldn't take long before we were attacked by the [[Sentinels]] again, and this time me, [["Taggy"]] and [[Andraste Helder]] got charged by a [[Sentinels]] as it opened a rift to [[Black Space]] and teleported us into it.
> 
> Once we returned we explored the rest of the tower where we found the assumingly creator of these [[Sentinels]]. It was a skeletal corpse with robes over him and a letter ([[Note left by the Sentinel Runesmith]]). Here we also found a [[Sentinel Artefact]] without its casing, and with a little bit of knowledge, we found out we could use it for ourselves.
> 
> We found a place to rest inside the tower, though the very next day, the center of the tower starting pulsing with this purple lightning marks and grew increasingly in size. [[Maralog]] managed to notice a hand sticking out of a pile of rocks from the balcony where we could look into the center. Something smells suspicious...
> 
> Upon entering the center of the room, we encountered a tall ronin, who appeared to be cursed by [[Kh√°os]], similar to how the [[Sentinels]] looked like, but this one seemed to be more puppetted than constructed. We fought it off and the tower was safe once more.
