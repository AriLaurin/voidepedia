### **Brígida Ó Corbin — Backstory**

Brígida was born in the old and forgotten mining town of **Blackfield Creek**, buried deep in the frost-cloaked badlands of northern Sohneria. Life there was hard, chiseled from ice and silence. The mines had long since dried, leaving behind broken shafts and broken spirits. Her family—miners turned trappers—spoke often of _leaving_, of crossing the mountain pass to the warm lands under imperial law. But in Blackfield Creek, _leaving_ was a dream whispered behind closed doors, because leaving meant facing the wild—the monster, and old, unspeaking things that prowled the high paths.

When Brígida was just nine winters old, her family made the attempt. Packed lightly, they joined two other families under the moonlight, slipping past the rusted iron bell that marked the village border. They never made it. In the dead frost of the pass, under a sunless sky, something found them. Brígida survived by falling into a crevice hidden beneath snowdrift—a narrow pocket of rock and root. She clawed her way out three days later to find blood and bone half-buried in ice. Alone, starving, and frostbitten, she limped forward through the mountains until the lands began to flatten, and paths of civilization was found.

She was found days later by a fur trader on the empire’s side of the pass. He left her at a temple hospice, and she never learned his name.

Brígida spent her teen years adrift, never staying long in one village. Eventually, she claimed a forgotten stone cottage in the **Mist Mourn Forests**, a dense stretch of pine and fog where whispers carried in the wind. There, she lived off the land—hunting, trapping, surviving. The forest was hers in a way no town ever was.

Once every few moons, she journeyed south to **Rockmaw**, a rugged village nestled between cliff and vale. The trek took a week in fair weather, longer in storm. In Rockmaw, Brígida sold pelts, took on odd jobs—tracking missing livestock, clearing out cave nests, escorting caravans between hamlets. She became a solitary mercenary with old eyes and a bow of bone and iron.

In her twenty-third year, Brígida took a rare contract that led her farther south, to the coastal town of **Moonkiss Harbour**, where the air tasted of salt and wine rather than snow and ash. There, in a quiet tavern marked by a carved lunar sigil above the hearth, she met a man known only as _Corven_. He spoke in riddles and references—old-world sayings no longer spoken. It was clear he wasn’t just a contact; he was a recruiter.

Corven belonged to the **Children of Before**. He claimed no leader, no orders. Just purpose. He told her they needed people who _remembered_ the old places. People who could move quietly across the untraveled roads, through woods and ruins the Empire feared to touch. Brígida didn’t ask questions—she didn’t care about rebellion or justice. But they paid well, and the jobs let her move freely.

For the next four years, Brígida served as a _guide_, helping smugglers, relic-hunters, and whisper-mages cross the cold lands of the north unnoticed. Few could navigate the winter wilds. Fewer still knew the paths untouched by Slayers or beasts. Brígida did.

Though she worked alone, Corven remained her anchor. They’d meet at Moonkiss Harbour —quick exchanges of goods, information, and coded missives. The Children never asked her to fight. Just to get people through.

Now twenty-seven, Brígida still lives in her cottage, though the forest grows darker each year. The Empire tightens its grip. The monsters grow bolder. She remains good, driven not by loyalty to empire or rebel—but by survival and memory.
